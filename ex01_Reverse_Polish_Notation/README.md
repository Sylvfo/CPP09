## CPP09 / ex01 – Reverse Polish Notation

The goal of this exercise is to **evaluate mathematical expressions written in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)** using a stack-based calculator.

Reverse Polish Notation is a mathematical notation where operators follow their operands, eliminating the need for parentheses

### 🧩 Technical Skills

C++ (98 standard) · Stack data structure (std::stack) · String parsing and tokenization · Expression evaluation algorithms · Error handling and input validation · Operator precedence (implicit in RPN)

### Something interesting about this project ✨
Thinking about math in a different way, close to how a computer compute... on a stack
short but challenging, elegant
algo 

### 🖥️ Compilation & Usage

- **Supported operators:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- **Input:** Single-digit positive integers (0-9) separated by spaces

```bash
$> make
$> ./RPN "expression"
$> ./RPN "8 9 * 9 - 9 - 9 - 4 - 1 +"
42
$> ./RPN "1 2 * 2 / 2 * 2 4 - +"
0
$> ./RPN "(1 + 1)"
Error
```
